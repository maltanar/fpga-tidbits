# fpga-tidbits
A collection of Chisel hardware generators for small but useful components for FPGA projects. 

There is some documentation available on the ([wiki](https://github.com/maltanar/fpga-tidbits/wiki)), but is rather incomplete. The best source of information is taking a look at the source code (most components are pretty small) or sending me an ([e-mail](mailto:maltanar@gmail.com)).

Contributors and pull requests are welcome!
